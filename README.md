# TravPass

TravPass is a Flutter app that allows passengers to pay for their commutes using QR-Codes that are dynamically generated by a different app version being utilised by MTA officials (called conductors). The app was built as a pilot project for SACCOs in Nairobi, and it allows for a passenger to have a mobile wallet that can easily be refilled using M-PESA and stored within the application. The backend of the app was done using Laravel and hosted on a server. The two were connected using PHP-based APIs. The database used was MySQL.
